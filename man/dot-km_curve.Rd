\title{Pure-R Kaplanu2013Meier curve calculator (lightweight fallback)}
\usage{
.km_curve(durations, events, timeline = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{durations}{Numeric vector of observed durations (time-to-event or censoring).}

\item{events}{Integer or logical vector indicating event occurrence (1 for event, 0 for censored).}

\item{timeline}{Optional numeric vector of time points to evaluate; if NULL uses unique sorted durations.}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns: time, at_risk, events, survival.
}
\description{
Compute Kaplanu2013Meier survival estimates at each timepoint in \code{timeline}.
This is a small, dependency-free implementation used as a fallback when
a dedicated survival package is not desired.

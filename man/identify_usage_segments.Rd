\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with a Person query containing the metric to be
classified. The data frame must include a \code{PersonId} column and a
\code{MetricDate} column.}

\item{metric}{A string representing the name of the metric column to be
classified. This parameter is used when a single column represents the
metric.}

\item{metric_str}{A character vector representing the names of multiple
columns to be aggregated for calculating a target metric, using row sum for
aggregation. This is used when \code{metric} is not provided.}

\item{version}{A string indicating the version of the classification to be
used. Valid options are \code{"12w"} for a 12-week rolling average, \code{"4w"}
for a 4-week rolling average, or \code{NULL} when using custom parameters. Defaults to \code{"12w"}.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value specifying the minimum number of times the
metric sum up to in order to be a valid count. A 'greater than or equal to'
logic is used. Only used when \code{version} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{width}{Integer specifying the number of qualifying counts to consider
for a habit. Only used when \code{version} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{max_window}{Integer specifying the maximum unit of dates to consider a
qualifying window for a habit. Only used when \code{version} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{return}{A string indicating what to return from the function. Valid
options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"data"}: Returns the data frame with usage segments.
\item \code{"plot"}: Returns a plot of the usage segments.
}}
}
\value{
Depending on the \code{return} parameter, either a data frame with usage
segments or a plot visualizing the segments over time. If \code{"data"} is passed
to \code{return}, the following additional columns are appended:
\itemize{
\item When \code{version} is \code{"12w"} or \code{"4w"}:
\itemize{
\item \code{IsHabit12w}: Indicates whether the user has a habit based on the 12-week
rolling average.
\item \code{IsHabit4w}: Indicates whether the user has a habit based on the 4-week
rolling average.
\item \code{UsageSegments_12w}: The usage segment classification based on the
12-week rolling average.
\item \code{UsageSegments_4w}: The usage segment classification based on the 4-week
rolling average.
}
\item When \code{version} is \code{NULL}:
\itemize{
\item \code{IsHabit}: Indicates whether the user has a habit based on the provided
parameters.
\item \code{UsageSegments}: The usage segment classification based on the provided
parameters.
}

\description{
This function identifies users into usage segments based on their usage
volume and consistency. The segments 'Power Users', 'Habitual Users', 'Novice
Users', 'Low Users', and 'Non-users' are created. There are two versions, one
based on a rolling 12-week average (\code{version = "12w"}) and the other on a
rolling 4-week average (\code{version = "4w"}). While a main use case is for
Copilot metrics e.g. 'Total_Copilot_actions', this function can be applied to
other metrics, such as 'Chats_sent'.
}
\details{
There are two versions of usage segments, one based on a rolling 12-week
period (\code{version = "12w"}) and the other on a rolling 4-week period (\code{version = "4w"}). This function assumes that in the input dataset is grouped at the
weekly level by the \code{MetricDate} column.

The definitions of the segments as per the 12-week definition are
as follows:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Power User}: Averaging 15+ weekly actions and any actions in at least
9 out of past 12 weeks
\item \strong{Habitual User}: Any action in at least 9 out of past 12 weeks
\item \strong{Novice User}: Averaging at least one action over the last 12 weeks
\item \strong{Low User}: Any action in the past 12 weeks
\item \strong{Non-user}: No actions in the past 12 weeks
}

The definitions of the segments as per the 4-week definition are
as follows:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Power User}: Averaging 15+ weekly actions and any actions in at least 4
out of past 4 weeks
\item \strong{Habitual User}: Any action in at least 4 out of past 4 weeks
\item \strong{Novice User}: Averaging at least one action over the last 4 weeks
\item \strong{Low User}: Any action in the past 4 weeks
\item \strong{Non-user}: No actions in the past 4 weeks
}

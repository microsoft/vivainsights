# Introduction

Welcome to the Analyst Guide of the **vivainsights** R package. This
document will guide you through the installation process, explain the
package functionality and structure, and get you comfortable with some
common functions for analysis.

## Before we begin…

Make sure you have: 1. Analyst access to [Viva
Insights](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/insightss) 2.
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) installed in your local device.

An IDE is optional, but we recommend either [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) or [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Why use R for Viva Insights?

There are multiple reasons:

1.  **Cutting edge data science**: R is an open-source language that is
    known for its active user community and a wide range of packages
    that together enable the quick and effective implementation of data
    science techniques.
2.  **Reproducibility**: Code-based workflows help facilitate
    reproducible analysis, which is the notion that analysis should be
    built in a way that is replicable by others. R as a tool promotes
    this good practice.
3.  **Efficiency / scalability**: R scales relatively well in the
    context of large datasets. The application of functions and
    automated processes also help cut down routine analysis time
4.  **Integration**: If you already use R as part of your analysis
    toolkit, adopting this package as part of the workflow will be
    seamless and easy
5.  **Extensibility**: One of the most appealing feature of R is the
    access it offers to a wide range of packages. For instance,
    clustering and text mining can be done very easily as part of a R
    workflow – which are both available in this package
